Exercise01: Run similar query to determine the employees (first name, last name, salary, department id) that earn less than the average salary of the IT department.

Algorithm to work out the answer

STEP 1. what is the department id for the IT department

STEP 2. work out the average salary from the department, corresponding to the IT department.

5760 – FROM simply from a postage stamp calculation

STEP 3. Write the main query - and use the average salary amount to get a view of the output (THE ANSWER)

select first_name, last_name, salary

from employees

where salary < 5760;

STEP 4: Rewrite the query this time with the main + subquery - to generate same answer as STEP 3

 

Algorithm to work out the answer

Exercise02: Determine all of the employees earning more than the minimum salary earnt in the sales department

 

STEP 1. What is the department id for the sales department

STEP 2. work out the minimum salary from the department, corresponding to the sales department.

STEP 3. Write the main query - and use the min salary from sales department amount to get a view of the output (THE ANSWER)

select min(salary)

from employees

where department_id = 8;

 

 

 

STEP 4: Rewrite the query this time with the main + subquery - to generate same answer as STEP 3

 

select first_name, last_name, salary

from employees

where salary > all (select min(salary) from employees where department_id = 8)

order by salary;

 

 

             
Construct an sql that will find <> which means no matches
 
SELECT 
    first_name, last_name, salary, department_id
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    salary <> ALL (SELECT 
            AVG(salary)
        FROM
            employees
        GROUP BY department_id)
ORDER BY salary DESC; 
 

No where statement here – so what is it comparing?

Not returning a single value – its return a series of values that correspond to the Averages from each of the departments.
